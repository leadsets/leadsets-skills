description: "Turns one or more company homepages into structured profiles: what the company sells, who it sells to, positioning, customers named on the site and key links, using Leadsets scrape_company. Checks scrape units first and probes one domain before a batch. Use when someone asks to profile a company website, summarize what a domain sells, or turn a list of homepages into a research sheet."

# Homepage to company profile

Gives you a clean, structured profile of any company from its own public homepage: products, audience, proof points such as named customers, and the links worth reading next. Built for founders, SDRs and GTM engineers who want account context in a table instead of ten open browser tabs.

**Category:** Web scraping · **Outcome:** Research accounts and timing · **Tools:** `get_usage`, `scrape_company`

## Requirements

- The Leadsets MCP server connected to your agent: `https://mcp.leadsets.ai` ([setup](https://www.leadsets.ai/docs/mcp)), or a Leadsets API key for the REST API.
- A Leadsets account. The free plan includes 1,000 records, no card ([get a key](https://www.leadsets.ai/signup)).

## When to use

- "Read stackfold.io and tell me what they sell and who they sell to."
- "Profile these 30 domains from their homepages and put it in a sheet."
- "Which customers does parcelry.co name on its site?"
- Before writing outreach or tiering accounts, when you need what a company says about itself in a structured form
- When a CRM has company records with domains but no description of products or audience

## What you give it

- **Domains**: One domain or a list (pasted, CSV or Google Sheet column). Bare domains or full URLs are fine; the skill normalizes them to the homepage.
- **Fields to keep** (optional): Default: products, sells_to, positioning, customers named, key links. Narrow it if you only need one thing, such as customers named.
- **Where it goes** (optional): Chat summary for 1 to 3 domains, otherwise CSV or Google Sheets. Default: CSV.
- **Unit budget** (optional): Maximum scrape units to spend on this run. Default: stop if remaining units would drop below what the full list needs and ask before continuing.

## Steps

1. **Confirm the domains and the output**
   Normalize every input to a bare domain, drop duplicates and obvious non-company domains, and confirm the count and destination with the user. Ask one question only if the list is ambiguous, for example a subdomain versus the main site.
2. **Check scrape units and plan the run** · `get_usage`
   Call get_usage (it costs nothing) and read scrape_units. If the account is on the free plan or has no scrape units, stop and explain that scrape_company is a paid add-on in units (packs from $9 for 1,000) rather than calling the tool. Otherwise estimate the run at a few pages per domain, since scrape_company caps page depth per domain, and compare against remaining units and the user's budget.
3. **Probe with one domain** · `scrape_company`
   Call scrape_company on the first domain only. Check that it returns sells, sells_to and key links, and note pages_read and units_used. Use units_used from this probe to re-estimate the full run before moving on; if the estimate exceeds remaining units or budget, tell the user and offer to run a subset.
4. **Profile the remaining domains** · `scrape_company`
   Call scrape_company for each remaining domain in small batches. After each batch, read units_used and stop before the budget is crossed. On a 429, wait for the Retry-After time and retry; the blocked call counts against nothing. If a domain returns nothing usable, mark it no data and move on rather than retrying.
5. **Assemble the profiles**
   For each domain, map the result to: products, sells_to, positioning (one line in the company's own terms), customers named, and key links (pricing, customers or case studies, careers, docs where present). Keep only what the page states. Leave a field empty and flag it rather than guessing an audience or customer the site does not name.
6. **Deliver and report**
   Return a chat summary for up to 3 domains, otherwise write the table to the chosen CSV or Google Sheet through the agent's own connection. End with a run summary: domains profiled, domains with no data, units used and units left.

## Checks before returning

- get_usage was called before any scrape and the run stayed inside remaining scrape units and the user's budget
- Every domain appears once; duplicates and redirects to the same site were merged
- Each profile field comes from the scraped page; empty fields are flagged, not filled with guesses
- Domains with no usable result are listed separately with the reason (no data, blocked or unreachable) instead of silently dropped
- Units used per domain and in total are reported, so the user can plan the next batch

## Output

One row per domain with columns: domain, company, products, sells_to, positioning, customers_named, key_links, pages_read, units_used, status (profiled or no data). For CSV or Google Sheets, write a "Profiles" tab and a "No data" tab listing domains that returned nothing usable and why. For 1 to 3 domains, return the same fields as a short profile per company in chat. This skill returns no contact data, so no email statuses apply; if the user wants people or verified emails, hand the domains to a prospecting or enrichment skill.

## Example

> Profile these 25 domains from their homepages: what they sell, who they sell to and which customers they name. Put it in a Google Sheet.

```
✓ 25 domains, 24 unique  ·  ✓ 1,840 scrape units left
✓ Probe on stackfold.io: 6 pages, 6 units
✓ 22 profiled  ·  2 no data (separate tab)  ·  131 units used
→ Sheet "Homepage profiles – Nov" created, 2 tabs
```

Illustrative output.

## Cost and limits

scrape_company uses 1 scrape unit per standard page read and does not touch search or enrichment records. Page depth is capped per domain, so each domain costs a predictable number of units, reported as units_used. Scraping is a units add-on on paid plans (packs of 1,000 for $9, 5,000 for $19, 20,000 for $49) and is not available on the free plan. The skill calls get_usage first at no cost, probes one domain to measure units per domain, and stops before crossing the user's budget or remaining units. Over a limit, Leadsets returns a 429 with a Retry-After time and the blocked call counts against nothing.

## What it doesn't do

- Find people or emails at the company; use a prospecting or enrichment skill for contacts and verified emails
- Read anything behind a login, paywall or outside the public homepage pages scrape_company reads
- Invent firmographics, audience or customers the site does not state; it does not call enrich_company for headcount or industry
